Monialaprojekti PRO4TN004-3005
A simple Arduino and Raspberry Pi based access control system built for a course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.
The aim of the project was to create a system where the Arduino controls a solenoid lock with a keypad and then transmits a signal using a nrf24L01+ transmitter to a Raspberry Pi which logs the event and publishes the log on a webserver.
